= Admin Theme

It is a simple PrimeFaces theme where components are styled to look like AdminLTE ones (which in turn are based on Bootstrap).

== Prerequisites

The only pre-requisite is `PrimeFaces` and `Font Awesome`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Since PrimeFaces `5.1.1` font awesome comes embedded.

For previous version or if you need to upgrade FA version you may include it in your pages by using webjars:

[source,html]
----
<h:outputStylesheet library="webjars" name="font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome-jsf.css" />
----

and add web jar in your classpath:

[source,xml]
----
include::{projectRoot}/pom.xml[tags=dep-webjar]
----

====

== Usage

To start using the theme you need the following:

. Add admin theme to your classpath:
+
[source,xml]
----
include::{projectRoot}/pom.xml[tags=dep-admin-theme]
----
. Activate the theme in `web.xml`
+
[source,xml]
----
<context-param>
    <param-name>primefaces.THEME</param-name>
    <param-value>admin</param-value>
</context-param>
----
+
NOTE: If you use <Admin Template> the theme already comes activated.

Now PrimeFaces components are styled like Bootstrap and AdminLTE.
